Welcome!
```

I'm Ethan. This is my little [[thoughts/hypertext|hypertext]] [[posts/networked-thought|garden]] on the [[thoughts/Internet|Internet]] -- make yourself at home!

Currently, I'm exploring what [[thoughts/agency|link]] and [[posts/agentic-computing|link]] technology looks like at [[link]] and through my [[link]]. How might we create infrastructures and technologies that empower the residents of the web to have access to the same tools as the architects?

On a broader level, I care deeply about creating [[link]] that enable others to have more [[thoughts/link]]: agency to ask questions without judgement; agency to do what they are intrinsically drawn toward; agency to [[thoughts/play|link]] (because what's the point if we can't have a bit of fun?).

As far as 'about' pages go, I hope this acts as an open invitation into the many winding paths throughout this garden. Here are some places you may want to visit:

- [[things to remember]]: a collection of my favourite [[thoughts/writing|link]];
- [link](thoughts/craft.md): craft I am proud of (websites, talks, workshops, projects, etc.);
- [link](/books): books that are in some state of read, being read, or to be read.
