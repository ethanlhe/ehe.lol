Welcome!
```

I'm Ethan, a third-year Computer Science student at UC Davis. Here in my online space, I share insights, thoughts, and work from my ongoing exploration of how technology can be seamlessly integrated into daily life for long-term benefits.

**My Interests:**

- **Innovative Infrastructure:** Developing technologies that are practical and sustainable for everyday use.
- **Empowerment Through Technology:** Creating tools that enhance individual agencyâ€”allowing for more personal freedom, thoughtful engagement, and of course, a bit of fun.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find the content interesting and useful!
