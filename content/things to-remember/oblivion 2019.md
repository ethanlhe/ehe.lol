Eternal oblivion: The notion my brain often drifts to whenever my mind is vacant and its vastness engulfs itself within the idea’s indescribability and abstractness. If you aren’t lucky enough to be religious, you likely share a similar perspective. Within the limits of the English language, eternal oblivion can only be described as the belief in a state of absolute nothingness before one’s birth and after one’s death — not a state of unconsciousness, but no consciousness.

  

Oblivion is a condition in which we remain.

It is where we remain despite the blood, sweat, and tears we have put into just living our lives.

It is where we remain after a lifetime of cultivating connections with people, the earth, and ourselves. 

It is where we remain as an inanimate object for an infinite amount of time unimpressed by our actions on earth.

It is where we remain — the serial killers and rapists, and the peace activists and teachers.

  

 This concept of finality naturally begs the question “why try? I will die.” Despairing as this sounds, it is a reality.

The idea of an inescapable fate usually has this effect. The feeling of being trapped within the confinements of your own life. The pressure of having only one chance. The tragedy of instantly losing everything so near and dear to your heart.

But still, thinking like this is recursive and unproductive. Why let the why behind your actions be impacted by the will of your life.

  

Why.

  

Why choose to live so narrowly.

  

I know that my view isn’t the norm for the majority of people in America. Oblivion competes against the ideologies of western religion, completely dismantling the notions of positive and negative reinforcement that promise some sort of bliss after death if people act ethically. Instead, oblivion promises nothing —absolutely nothing— making each individual act completely genuine. Holding the door open for someone isn’t for the lingering hope that doing so will get you a tiny bit closer to reaching heaven. It is for the pure feeling of fulfillment for doing a good deed. It is for yourself.

I subscribe to the idea that life is meaningful because each individual life is an embodiment of the entirety of the universe. André Comte-Sponville, a french philosopher termed this the “oneness of the universe”. This idea submits to the belief that the universe is all that exists and all that will ever exist. Knowing this makes us each fundamental cogs of the universe because we are that universe. Being the elemental part of our universe means we must perpetuate it, which as a result gives meaning to our lives. The constant struggle of simply being is what many of us take for granted and forget to realize is what gives us meaning. It is realizing that everything is fundamental to existence because every action and reaction are all real and true according to the universe. We must redefine the idea of struggling to find meaning in our being — our meaning is being.

It is learning to love ice cream; even if it makes your fingers stick together after it melts in your hands.

It is learning to love thunderstorms; even if at some nights, the spontaneous cracks of thunder wake you up at night.

It is learning to love Chicago; even if the winters spread ice across the streets and the frozen winds keep your eyelids stuck together.

It is learning to love what is — what everything is.

Oblivion shouldn’t discourage you. Just the opposite. It should motivate you: motivate you to realize the life you are living. Believing in this idea that there is no afterlife is the greatest instigator for realizing your present life. The flow of vitality in life should be seen completely independent from the overbearing shadow that oblivion may cast. Real-life encourages passion against an oblivion in which none exists

Oblivion contains nothing. Life contains everything. This realization is what counteracts the conformity that society pushes upon individuals. Although we each end up the same, what differentiates us is how we fulfilled ourselves on earth. If this is true, then simply living for the end, living how society wants you to, is not living. Accepting this, accepting oblivion, leaves us with one way to live: to live for the moment, to live for the perpetual desire to fill the infinitely deep glass of fulfillment that is purpose.

I will always fear oblivion. Oblivion scares me more than anything. Just the idea that one day I won’t wake up. That I won’t be on this earth anymore. That even after my death, life goes on and others will continue to live. It is unimaginable. Yet still, oblivion is my greatest motivation to live. Simply because there is a definite end does not mean there is no point or consequence to the events prior to it. My ultimate reality (or lack thereof) may be the same as that of the Zodiac Killer, but that doesn’t change the outcome of my actions on earth. My desire to live decently is in the present moment and motivated by the reality I experience. 

I don’t want to believe in oblivion, but it seems as if I have no choice. It’s all that makes sense to me and its enormous beauty terrifies me.

  

I am living right now.

  

Oblivion: my greatest fear, my greatest motivation.
